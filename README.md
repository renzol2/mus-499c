# MUS 499C: Creative Audio Coding

My code for **MUS 499C: Creative Audio Coding** at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, taught by [Professor Eli Fieldsteel](https://www.elifieldsteel.com/).

I took this class over two semesters:

- Fall 2022, where we covered the basics of SuperCollider. My final project is a recreation of several audio effects featured in XLN Audio's RC-20 plugin.
- Spring 2023, where we did work using the Ambisonic Toolkit in EMS's new Studio Z.
